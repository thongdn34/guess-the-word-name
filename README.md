## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps
4. Add a web app and copy the configuration
5. Update `.env.local` with your Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 2. OpenAI Setup

1. Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Add it to `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Deploy Firestore Rules

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Initialize: `firebase init firestore`
4. Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the game.

## How to Play

1. **Create or Join Room**: Enter a username and either create a new room or join an existing one using a room ID
2. **Wait for Players**: Up to 6 players can join a room
3. **Generate Words**: The host can generate Vietnamese word pairs using OpenAI
4. **Start Round**: The host starts the round, and one player is randomly selected as the "Importer"
5. **Play**: 
   - The Importer sees Word A (red card) and tries to get others to guess it
   - Other players see Word B (blue card) and try to guess the Importer's word
6. **Mark Winner**: The host selects the winner who gets 50 points
7. **Repeat**: Start a new round with new words

## Game Rules

- Each round has one Importer and multiple Guessers
- The Importer must get others to guess their word without saying it directly
- Other players try to guess the Importer's word based on their hints
- The host controls the game flow and marks winners
- Winners receive 50 points per round
- Scores persist throughout the room session

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore, Next.js API Routes
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for Vietnamese word generation
- **Real-time**: Firestore real-time listeners
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)
